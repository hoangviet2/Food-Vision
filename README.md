# Food-Vision
This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify food images, using the **Food-101** dataset as the benchmark. The goal is to build a computer vision model capable of recognizing different food categories with high accuracy, supporting applications such as dietary tracking, nutrition logging, and health monitoring.
